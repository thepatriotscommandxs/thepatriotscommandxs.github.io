['Jorge Luis Borges', ' BOR;hayss (18991986) was an Argentine short story writer who often dealt with meta;fictional themes. His story The Library of Babel depicts an infinite library made up of hexagonal rooms, which contain every possible 410;page book. In Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote, the fictional 20th;century author Pierre Menard writes a line;by;line reproduction of Cervantess Don Quixote, which is much more interesting than the original because of the historical context in which the new version was produced. Borgess story Tln, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius describes an imaginary realm, created by a secret society of intellectuals, that gradually intrudes into the world of the story. The Aleph is named after a point from which every other point in the universe can be perceived. Many of Borgess best;known stories appeared in the collections Ficciones and Labyrinths, the latter of which is named after a common motif in Borgess work. For example, in The Garden of Forking Paths the author Tsui Pn tries to create a metaphorical labyrinth by writing a novel in which every event is followed by every possible outcome. The story is narrated by Tsui Pns descendent, Dr. Yu Tsun, who kills the Sinologist Stephen Albert to convey a coded message to German forces during World War I.']
