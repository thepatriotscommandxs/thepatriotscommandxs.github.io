['Harpers Weekly', ' (18571916) was the most popular American magazine during the Civil War. In 1863 it published an article about a slave named Gordon along with a widely circulated photograph of his whipped, mutilated back that roused abolitionist sentiment across the North. George William Curtis, a co;founder of the Republican Party, was its political editor from 1863 to 1892, during which time he ran cartoons by Thomas Nast, including Nasts portrayals of Boss Tweed and the Tammany Hall political machine. (Although Nasts Harpers Weekly work did popularize American symbols like Uncle Sam, Columbia, and the Democratic donkey, Nast was not the inventor of those symbols.)']

Rockefeller as a king with an huge crown of railroads, Uncle Sam as a schoolteacher looming over racist caricatures of its new territories, and Columbia admiring her bonnet of gunboats in a mirror.

In 1901 its staff writer Ray Stannard Baker published What the U.S. Steel Corporation Really Is, and How It Works. In 1902 it ran Ida Tarbells The History of the Standard Oil Company.

['Cosmopolitan', ' (1886present) began as a classy, largely inoffensive magazine until 1965, when Helen Gurley Brown became its editor and made it a womens magazine geared towards fashion and romantic relationships. (Three years prior, Brown rose to fame for her popular, controversial non;fiction book Sex and the Single Girl.) Cosmopolitans new angle was viewed as misogynistic by most leading feminists; copies were burned alongside Playboy at protests against the 1968 Miss America pageant. In 1989 it ran an article falsely stating heterosexual women cannot contract HIV, prompting protests from ACT UP and other gay organizations.']
['Time', ' (1923present) was the U.S.s first weekly newsmagazine. Its founder, Henry Luce, used its near;instant success to create a stable of influential magazines, including Life, Fortune, and Sports Illustrated. Since 1927 it has designated various figures as Person of the Year (originally Man of the Year), the first being Charles Lindbergh; controversial picks for the award include Adolf Hitler in 1938 and Joseph Stalin in both 1939 and 1942. In June 1994, Time was criticized for darkening the mugshot of O. ;J. Simpson on its cover, especially juxtaposed against Newsweeks largely undoctored version on their cover the same month.

['National Review', ' (1955present) was founded by the foremost leader of the American conservative movement in the 20th century, William F. Buckley Jr., and aimed from its outset to define and promote right;wing thought. Its earliest editors were staunch anti;Communists like Whittaker Chambers. Under Buckley, National Review expanded conservatisms allies to include libertarians while disavowing anti;Semitic and nativist elements, such as the John Birch Society.

Buckley parlayed his success with National Review into hosting PBSs Firing Line from 1966 to 1999.']
['Rolling Stone', ' (1967present) was founded in San Francisco as a rock and roll magazine, but it quickly became notable for its experimental political journalism.

The magazine is indelibly associated with the gonzo journalism of Hunter S. Thompsonhis seminal novel Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and the political piece Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail 72 first appeared in Rolling Stone. After becoming more Hollywood;geared in the 1990s, in the 2000s it re;oriented itself towards politics.

['Ms.', ' (1971present) is a pioneering feminist magazine, founded by Gloria Steinem and Dorothy Pitman Hughes.
