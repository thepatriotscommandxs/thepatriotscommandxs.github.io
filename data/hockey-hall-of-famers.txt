['Gordie Howe', ' (19262016):  Born in Floral, Saskatchewan, Mr. Hockey, was equally adept with his stick as he was with his fists. A Gordie Howe hat trick was later joked to consist of a goal, an assist, and a fight. A six;time Art Ross Trophy winner, he played 26 seasons with the Detroit Red Wings, retiring in 1971. After a two;year retirement, he returned to the fledgling WHA, to play with his sons on the Houston Aeros. He played his last NHL season at the age of 52 in 1980 with the Hartford Whalers, finishing as the NHLs career points leader until 1989.']
['Mario Lemieux', ' (1965present):  Born in Montreal, Quebec, Super Mario scored his first NHL goal on the first shift of his first game, against Boston in 1984. He led the Pittsburgh Penguins to consecutive Stanley Cups in 19911992. After a bout with Hodgkins disease, he returned to lead the NHL in scoring in 19951996 and 19961997.

['Bobby Orr', ' (1948present):  Born in Parry Sound, Ontario, Bobby Orr revolutionized the position of defenseman.

He recorded the highest  rating ever for a single season, +124 in 19701971, and won eight straight Norris Trophies from 19681975. Unfortunately, his bad knees forced him into early retirement in 1979.']
['Maurice Richard', ' (19212000):  Born in Montreal, Quebec, The Rocket was one of the most gifted offensive players in NHL history. He was the first NHL player to score 50 goals in a single season, doing so in 19441945, and also the first to score 500 ;goals in a career. The winner of eight Stanley Cups, his suspension by league president Clarence Campbell in 1955 led to The Richard Riot on March ;17, 1955, which was quelled only by an appeal by Richard for peace. Many sociologists credit the Richard Riot with contributing to the rise of the Quebec independence movement. The NHL began awarding the Rocket Richard Trophy in 1999 for the leagues top regular;season goal scorer.']
['Terry Sawchuk', ' (19291970):  Born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Ukey played more games (971), won more games (447), and recorded more shutouts (103) than any other netminder in NHL history.

He came to North American prominence when he starred in 1972 Summit Series against Canada. A ten;time World Champion, he also won three gold medals (1972, 1976, and 1984). The decision to pull Tretiak after the first period of the U.S./USSR game in the 1980 Olympics is considered to be part of the reason the U.S. went on to win the gold.

He later went on to be the owner/GM of the AHLs Springfield Indians, and the anecdotes about his stingy ways are now hockey lore.']
