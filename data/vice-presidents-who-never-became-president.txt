Burr made a covert effort to become president with support from the Federalist Party, but it was blocked by Alexander Hamilton, whom Burr later killed in a duel. In 1807 the Jefferson administration put Burr on trial for treason for plotting to set up his own country in land acquired from the Louisiana Purchase, though he was acquitted.']
['Elbridge Gerry', ' (17441814) was James Madisons second vice president, serving from 1813 to 1814 (when he died in office).

Pinckney, and John Marshall were sent to France as a diplomatic commission, but French agents demanded bribes during the XYZ Affair. As governor of Massachusetts in 1812, Gerry reluctantly approved a partisan redistricting plan.

Calhoun are the only vice presidents to resign from office. Agnew served as governor of Maryland, where his moderate reputation and law and order policies led Nixon to choose him as his running mate. Agnew became known as Nixons attack dog, unleashing such creative insults as calling liberals nattering nabobs of negativism. In 1973 an investigation into Agnews tenure as governor discovered that he had received bribes from contractors. Though he professed his innocence, Agnew ultimately pled no contest to tax evasion and resigned as vice president, ending his political career.']
