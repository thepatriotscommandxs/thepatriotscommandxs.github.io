['Pythagorean triples', ':  Sets of small integers that satisfy the equation of the Pythagorean theorem, a2 ;+ ;b2 ;= ;c2, and could therefore be the side lengths of a right triangle.  The simplest ones are {3, ;4, ;5}, {5, ;12, ;13}, {7, ;24, ;25}, and {8, ;15, ;17}.  Note that any multiple of a Pythagorean triple is also a Pythagorean triple, so (for instance) {6, ;8, ;10}, {15, ;20, ;25}, and {300, ;400, ;500} are also ones by virtue of {3, ;4, ;5} being one.']
['Matrices', ':  Every team should be able to add, subtract, multiply, take the determinant of, transpose, and invert matrices, particularly 22 ones.']
['Vectors', ':  Every team should be able to find the magnitude (length) of a vector, and add, subtract, find the angle between, find the dot product of, and find the cross product of two vectors.']
['Solids', ':  Teams should be able to calculate the volume and surface area of simple geometric figures including the sphere, cone, cylinder, pyramid, hemisphere, prism, and parallelepiped.']
['Plane figures', ':  Teams should be able to calculate the areas of triangles, trapezoids, parallelograms, rhombi, regular polygons, and circles using several methods.']
['Similar figures', ':  The areas of similar figures are related by the square of any corresponding length, and the volumes are related by the cube of any corresponding length.  For instance, if a square has a diagonal that is 30% longer than another square, it has an area that is 1.30 ; ;1.30 ;= ;1.69 times as great (69% greater).  Similar reasoning applies to perimeters, side lengths, diameters, and so forth.']
['Combinatorics', ':  Teams should be able to compute the number of permutations and combinations of n objects taken m at a time.  They should also have memorized the first six (or so) values of the factorial function to make this easier.']
['Logarithms', ':  Teams should be familiar with basic operations of logarithmic math:  simplifying the logarithm of a product, difference, or power, and converting from one base to another.']
['Complex numbers', ':  Teams should be familiar with the symbol i representing an imaginary square root of 1, basic operations on complex numbers, graphing complex numbers, and converting complex numbers to polar form.']
['Divisibility rules', ':  Teams should be able to quickly apply the divisibility rules for small integers (2 through 11) to large integers.']
['Polynomials', ':  Teams should be able to quickly add, subtract, multiply, divide, factor, and find the roots of low;degree polynomials, and understand how the degree behaves under the first four operations.']
['Calculus', ':  Teams should be able to find the derivative, integral, slope at a point, local extrema, points of inflection, and critical points of polynomial, trigonometric, and other common functions.']
